Type Declaration instructions:

Example of a type declaration instruction program

#include <stdio.h>

int main()

{

int a = 4;
int b;
int c;
b = c = a;

printf("The value of a is %d\n", a);
printf("The value of b is %d\n", b);
printf("The value of c is %d\n", c);

return 0;


}

If the instructions are reverse ordered or written in a wrong oredered the compiler will show an error like in the following example

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
float b = a + 8.9
float a = 1.1;
printf("The value of b is %f\n", b);

return 0;

}

The above program will not get compiled and executed successfully because the "float a" instruction should be executed first and then the instruction "float b". Without 
knowing the value of a first how can the compiler execute the value of b which a + 1.8? It obviously cannot.



Arithmetic Instruction:

Example 1:

int b = 2;
int c = 3;
int z = b * c;

Example 2:

int z;
b * c = z;

Example 1 is correct and Example 2 is incorrect because "z = b * c" can be written but not "b * c = z"

Another Example:

printf("5 when divided by 2 leaves the remainder as %d\n", 5%2); // Output is 1
printf("-5 when divided by 2 leaves the remainder as %d\n", -5%2); // Output is -1
printf("5 when divided by 2 leaves the remainder as %d\n", 5%-2); // Output is 1

In the third line the output is 1 because only the sign of numerator is considered.

Example Program For Performing exponentiation in C:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {

printf("The value of 2 to the power 5 is %f\n", pow(2, 5)); // Ouput will be 32 and only %f should be used because it is returning a real value


return 0;

}

Arithmetic Conversion Example Programs:

printf("The value of 5/2 is %d\n", 5/2"); 
printf("The value of 5/2 is %f\n", 5/2);
printf("The value of 3.0/9 is %d\n", 3.0/9); // Output will be 0

Examples on operator precedency topic:

In the following program first 3*x and 4*y values are calculated and then the subtraction operation is done between those two values which gives the final result as -24
AS the top most priority in this case is given to multiplication operators and then to the subtraction operators.

Operators of higher priority are evaluated first in the absence of parenthesis.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

int x = 4;
int y = 9;

printf("The value of [3*x - 4*y] is %d\n", 3*x - 4*y); // Output for this program will be obviously -24

return 0;


In the following program

The value in the parenthesis will be evaluated first and then this calculated value is multiplied with 3 which gives the total result as -204

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

int x = 4;
int y = 9;

printf("The value of [3*(x - 8*y)] is %d\n", 3*(x - 8*y)); // In this case the output will be -204

return 0;

}


Example program of Tie between Operators:

When there is a Tie between Two Operators which happens when there are two same priority level operators involved in the overall operation we see something called as 
associativity.

Explanation of Operator Associativity: 
When operators of equal priority are present in an expression, the tie is taken care of by associativity.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

int x = 2;
int y = 3;

printf("The value of 8*y / 3*x is %d", 8*y / 3*x); // This program will give the wrong output which is 16. *, / operators follows left to right associativity(Explanation is given below)

return 0;

}

Explanation for what happened in the above program in detail: 8*3/3*2 = 24/3*2 = 8*2 = 16
